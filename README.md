You can now fill out your checklists and forms effectively anywhere and as native form apps - offline processing.
Almost any kind of native forms, checklists etc. can be generated as native app. The generation and distribution of the native forms are controlled by the BPMN-Engine from BonitaSoft. The forms are designed in a separate form designer and reused in a designed workflow of BonitaSoft.
Each co-worker can get his checklist or form that he is supposed to fill out and no one else, everything coordinated and dispatched by the BPMN-Engine from BonitaSoft.
